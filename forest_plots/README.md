# Code for making forest plots for top GWAS loci

This repository contains the script used to create forest plots for the top loci.

# Code contents

1. [forest_plots_mortality_script.R](https://github.com/huw-morris-lab/PD-survival-GWAS/blob/a989a89a811e1e4ce08f150b5d479c59371e00e3/forest_plots/forest_plots_script.R): This script extracts the top SNPs for the PD mortality GWAS. The summary statistics for 10 SNPs are extracted from each of the cohorts' GWAS results, combined them and then forest plots are created.

2. [forest_plots_HY3_script.R](https://github.com/huw-morris-lab/PD-survival-GWAS/blob/a989a89a811e1e4ce08f150b5d479c59371e00e3/forest_plots/forest_plots_script.R): This script extracts the top SNPs for the PD Hoehn and Yahr stage 3+ GWAS. The summary statistics for 10 SNPs are extracted from each of the cohorts' GWAS results, combined them and then forest plots are created. This also includes a sensitivity analysis where I included a proxy SNP in the Tracking Parkinson's cohort
